### Abstract
The Livox Lidar Stitching and Object Detection Suite is a Matlab application that takes .csv files of Point Clouds and can output stitched scenes or detect objects via a Point Pillars 
neural network. First, .lvx point cloud files are converted to .csv via the Livox Viewer, which is also used to generate .lvx point clouds via input from the Livox 
Horizon lidar sensor. Next, a .csv file is selected via the Matlab app gui and the user can select to either stitch a scene or detect objects. If Stitch Point Clouds is selected 
the Matlab application loads point clouds into memory, reading them from the .csv and then uses a Point Cloud registration algorithm to stitch together separate point clouds into a 
single point cloud representing a complete scene. If Detect Objects is selected, the point clouds are read into memory from the .csv file then converted to the organized point
cloud format. The point clouds are inserted into the Point Pillars neural network comparing against ground truth data we labelled to detect objects such as signs and cars
within the point clouds, which are represented by bounding boxes in the output point clouds.
